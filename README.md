# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study

Problem Statement
X Education, an online course provider for industry professionals, faces a low lead conversion rate of around 30%. Despite acquiring many leads through their website, landing pages, and referrals, only a small fraction converts into paying customers. The company seeks to improve this process by identifying 'Hot Leads'â€”those most likely to convert. The goal is to develop a logistic regression model to assign a lead score to each lead, helping the sales team focus on high-potential leads and ultimately aiming to increase the conversion rate to around 80%.
